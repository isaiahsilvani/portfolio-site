The Connect Four Browser Game was my first portfolio project which utilizes vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to create a mobile responsive adaption to a popular game. In addition to being fully functional, this project has features such as toggling sound, custom player names, randomizing who goes first, and simple yet sleek design.

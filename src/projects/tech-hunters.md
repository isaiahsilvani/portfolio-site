Tech Hunters is a job hunting application I made using NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express. The premise of this application is to search for relevant tech jobs using a 3rd party API, and keep track of each job's application process using MongoDB for persistent data. This application consumes the free Github Job API to produce search results based on user queries.
